It was a very uplifting experience and went a long way to instill in me the confidence to persue and complete this project. I am equally thankful to my mentor Ilya A., first for volunteering to be a KaggleX mentor and for all the help he gave me during the lenght of this program. Finally, I am thankful for the love, support and encouragements I receieved from family and friends. For without them, I would not have completed this project.\n","\n","**Goal**\n","\n","The goal of this project is to finetune a Gemma 2b model with therapy type conversational dataset. I hope to build a mental health conversational agent which can provide positive uplifting emmotional and mental health support to people of varied ages. This bot will not be a replacement for therapy; it will only help fill the gap by engaging in friendly conversations with those who need to talk to someone but can't for a variety of reasons.\n","\n","**Abstract**\n","\n","According to the American Psychiatric Association, Mental health is how a person functions in daily activities, while mental illness is the collective term for all diagnosable mental disorders. Mental illness continues to be a big issue in America and the world. According to MHA’s (Mental Health America) report, ‘Prevalence of Mental Illness 2024’, “the state prevalence of adult mental illness ranges from 19.38% in New Jersey to 29.19% in Utah”. Mental illness affects people of all ages, genders and races. The mental wellbeing of a person is very important as deteriorating mental health, resulting from ongoing signs and symptoms which causes persistent stress can lead to mental illness(Mayo clinic). The National Institute of Health (NIH) reports that 59.3 million adults in 2022; 23.1% of the U.S. adult population, live with some form of mental illness. The number of people living with mental illness continues to grow faster than the available services in terms of clinics and mental health professionals. According to AAMC, more than 150 million people live in federally designated mental health professional shortage areas. While this is already a big issue, experts say in a few years, the US will be short between 14,280 and 31,109 psychiatrists (NIH). In order to reach more people and breach the care gap, many organizations have designed conversational agents (mental health chatbots) to help people in distress. Some of these mental health agents include; MYLO, ELIZA ,WOEBOT, SHIM, SABORI, GABBY, ChatPal, Wysa, Youper, Replika and PEACH. Studies shows that interaction and adherence to mental health chatbots is typically low (Ennis, E. et al, 2023) and thus more work needs to be done to improve their appeal, usefulness and security.\n","\n","**Data collection and Cleaning**\n","\n","In this project, I finetuned a Gemma 2b model with therapy type conversational dataset. These conversation sets where designed as question and answer sets in some instances, and, statement and response sets in other instances. Most of the question and answer sets where designed to answer typical mental health questions like 'What is anxiety, ADHD ...?'. I used a glossery of mental heath topics obtained from mentalhealthliteracy.org. to design the question and answer sets. Some of the statement and response sets where obtained by genarating synthetic therapy type conversation using GPT-4o model. Topics for these synthetic conversations was obtained from aamft.org. Data was also extracted from four hugging face datasets, counsel chat by nbertagnolli, mental_health_counseling_conversations by Amod, new_mental_health_conversations_all1 by CalebE and Synthetic-Therapy-Conversations-Cleaned. Cleaning steps included, dropping duplicates, removing personal identifiers like phone numbers, names and titles for therapist and removing all non-english text and symbols. Resulting dataset has 302119 rows with two columns; Question and Response.\n","\n","\n"," "]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"4d19740b","metadata":{"id":"ZFWzQEqNosrS","papermill":{"duration":0.004838,"end_time":"2024-12-04T13:55:58.857291","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-12-04T13:55:58.852453","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# Fine-tune Gemma models in Keras using LoRA"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"f9e2e4d1","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.004787,"end_time":"2024-12-04T13:55:58.867144","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-12-04T13:55:58.862357","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["<table class=\"tfo-notebook-buttons\" align=\"left\">\n","  <td>\n","    <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/lora_tuning\"><img src=\"https://ai.google.dev/static/site-assets/images/docs/notebook-site-button.png\" height=\"32\" width=\"32\" />View on ai.google.dev</a>\n","  <td>\n","    <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/github/google/generative-ai-docs/blob/main/site/en/gemma/docs/lora_tuning.ipynb\"><img src=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/images/colab_logo_32px.png\" />Run in Google Colab</a>\n","  </td>\n","  <td>\n","    <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/publishers/google/model-garden/335\"><img src=\"https://ai.google.dev/images/cloud-icon.svg\" width=\"40\" />Open in Vertex AI</a>\n","  </td>\n","  <td>\n","    <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/google/generative-ai-docs/blob/main/site/en/gemma/docs/lora_tuning.ipynb\"><img src=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/images/GitHub-Mark-32px.png\" />View source on GitHub</a>\n","  </td>\n","</table>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"5ffb47f7","metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"id":"lSGRSsRPgkzK","papermill":{"duration":0.004801,"end_time":"2024-12-04T13:55:58.876998","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-12-04T13:55:58.872197","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["## Overview\n","\n","Gemma is a family of lightweight, state-of-the art open models built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models.\n","\n","Large Language Models (LLMs) like Gemma have been shown to be effective at a variety of NLP tasks. An LLM is first pre-trained on a large corpus of text in a self-supervised fashion. Pre-training helps LLMs learn general-purpose knowledge, such as statistical relationships between words. An LLM can then be fine-tuned with domain-specific data to perform downstream tasks (such as sentiment analysis).\n","\n","LLMs are extremely large in size (parameters in the order of millions). Full fine-tuning (which updates all the parameters in the model) is not required for most applications because typical fine-tuning datasets are relatively much smaller than the pre-training datasets.\n","\n","[Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685){:.external} is a fine-tuning technique which greatly reduces the number of trainable parameters for downstream tasks by freezing the weights of the model and inserting a smaller number of new weights into the model. This makes training with LoRA much faster and more memory-efficient, and produces smaller model weights (a few hundred MBs), all while maintaining the quality of the model outputs.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"bb4bf018","metadata":{"id":"w1q6-W_mKIT-","papermill":{"duration":0.004802,"end_time":"2024-12-04T13:55:58.886841","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-12-04T13:55:58.882039","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["## Setup"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"0dd38489","metadata":{"id":"lyhHCMfoRZ_v","papermill":{"duration":0.005027,"end_time":"2024-12-04T13:55:58.89688","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-12-04T13:55:58.891853","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["### Get access to Gemma\n","\n","To complete this tutorial, you will first need to complete the setup instructions at [Gemma setup](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/setup).
